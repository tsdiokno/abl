## Ang Tapat Na Tigapangasiwa
[#](# "The Faithful Manager")

PRINCIPLES OF MARRIAGE

Ngayon, bilang tugon sa mga bagay na sinulat ninyo: "Mabuti para sa isang lalaki na hindi maikapid sa isang babae."

[^1]: Now in response to the matters you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.”

Pero dahil ang pakikiapid ay laganap, hayaan na ang bawat isang lalaki ay makipag-siping sa sarili niyang awawa, at ang bawat babae ay makasiping ang kaniyang sariling asawa.

[^2]: But because sexual immorality is so common, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman should have sexual relations with her own husband.

Ang isang lalaking ay dapat gampanan ang kaniyang tungkuling pang-asawa sa kaniyang asawang, at ganun din ang babae sa kaniyang asawa.

[^3]: A husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise a wife to her husband.

Ang asawang babae ay walang karapatan sa sariki niyang katawan pero ang kaniyang asawang lalaki ay mayroon. Sa parehong paraan, ang asawang lalaki ay walang karapatan sa sarili niyang katawan, pero ang kaniyang asawang babae ay mayroon.

[^4]: A wife does not have the right over her own body, but her husband does. In the same way, a husband does not have the right over his own body, but his wife does.

Huwag kayong magkait sa isa't isa — bukod na lamang kung napagkasunduan ninyo na mag-alay ng panahon sa panalangin. Pagkatapos noon ay magsama muli kayo; kung hindi, maari kayong tuksuhin ni Satanas dahil sa kawalan ninyo ng pagtitimpi.

[^5]: Do not deprive one another ​— ​except when you agree for a time, to devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again; otherwise, Satan may tempt you because of your lack of self-control.

Sinasabi ko ito bilang isang panghihimok, hindi bilang isang kautusan.

[^6]: I say this as a concession, not as a command.

Nais ko na ang lahat ng tayo ay kagaya ko. Pero ang bawat isa ay may kani-kaniyang kaloob mula sa Diyos, ang isa ay mayroong ganitong kaloob, at ang isa naman ay may ganoon.

[^7]: I wish that all people were as I am. But each has his own gift from God, one person has this gift, another has that.

A WORD TO THE UNMARRIED
Isang Bilin Sa Mga Hindi Kasal

Ang sinasabi ko naman sa mga hindi kasal at sa mga namatayan ng asawa: mabuti para sa kanila na maging katulad ko.

[^8]: I say to the unmarried and to widows: It is good for them if they remain as I am.

Pero kung wala silang pagtitimpi, dapat silang magpakasal, dahil ma mabuti para sa kanila ang magpakasal kesa masunog sa pagnanasa.

[^9]: But if they do not have self-control, they should marry, since it is better to marry than to burn with desire.

ABOUT MARRIED PEOPLE
Tungkol Sa Mga Taong Kinasal Na

Para naman sa mga kinasal na, ito ang utos — hindi galing saakin, pero sa Panginoon — ang asawang babae ay hindi dapat makipaghiwalay sa kaniyang asawang lalaki.

[^10]: To the married I give this command ​— ​not I, but the Lord ​— ​a wife is not to leave her husband.

Pero kung siya ay makipaghiwalay, dapat siyang manatiling walang asawa o ipagkasundo sa kaniyang asawa — at ang asawang lalaki ay hindi dapat makipaghiwalay sa kaniyang asawang babae.

[^11]: But if she does leave, she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband ​— ​and a husband is not to divorce his wife.

Pero para naman sa lahat, ito ang sinasabi ko (hindi ng Panginoon): Kung meron mang lalaki dito ang may asawang hindi naniniwala at nais niyang sumama sa lalaki, hindi siya dapat hiwalayan ng lalaki.

[^12]: But I (not the Lord) say to the rest: If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.

Gayundin, kung meron mang babaeng may asawang hindi naniniwala at mais niyang sumama sa babae, hindi siya dapat hiwalayan ng babae.

[^13]: Also, if any woman has an unbelieving husband and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce her husband.

Dahil ang lalaking hindi naniniwala ay tinatangi sa pamamagitan ng kaniyang asawa, at ang babaeng hindi naniniwala ay tinatangi sa pamamagitan ng kaniyang asawa.

[^14]: For the unbelieving husband is made holy by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy by the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is they are holy.

Pero kung makikipaghiwalay yung hindi naniniwala, hayaan ninyong makipaghiwalay siya. Ang isang kapatid ay walang pananagutan sa ganung mga kaso. Tinawag kayo ng Diyos upang mamuhay ng mapayapa.

[^15]: But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. A brother or a sister is not bound in such cases. God has called you to live in peace.

Babae, malay mo, baka maligtas mo ang iyong asawa. Lalaki, malay mo, maligtas mo ang iyong asawa.

[^16]: Wife, for all you know, you might save your husband. Husband, for all you know, you might save your wife.

VARIOUS SITUATIONS OF LIFE
Iba't-Ibang Sitwasyon Sa Buhay

Hayaan ninyo na ang bawat isa ay mamuhay sa sitwasyon kung saan inilagay siya ng Panginoon nuong siya ay tinawag. Ito ang aking utos sa lahat ng mga tinawag.

[^17]: Let each one live his life in the situation the Lord assigned when God called him. This is what I command in all the churches.

Mayroon bang natuli na nuong tinawag siya? Hindi niya na kelangang bawiin pa ang kaniyang pagkatuli. Mayroon bang hindi natuli noong siya ay tinawag? Hindi niya na kelanang magpatuli.

[^18]: Was anyone already circumcised when he was called? He should not undo his circumcision. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? He should not get circumcised.

Ang pagkakatuli ay hindi mahalaga at ang hindi pagkatuli ay hindi mahalaga. Ang pagsunod sa mga utos ng Diyos ang mahalaga.

[^19]: Circumcision does not matter and uncircumcision does not matter. Keeping God’s commands is what matters.

Hayaan niyo na ang bawat isa ay manatili sa sitwasyon kung saan siya tinawag.

[^20]: Let each of you remain in the situation in which he was called.

Tinawag ka ba habang ikaw ay may amo? Wag mong pakaisipin yoon. Pero kung ikaw ay maaring nang humiwalay sa iyong amo, kunin mo ang pagkakataon sa anumang paraan.

[^21]: Were you called while a slave? Don’t let it concern you. But if you can become free, by all means take the opportunity.

Sahil ang sinumang tinawag ng Panginoon nang may amo ay pinalaya na niya. Gayundin, si Kristo ang amo ng sinumang pinalaya na.

[^22]: For he who is called by the Lord as a slave is the Lord’s freedman. Likewise he who is called as a free man is Christ’s slave.

Ikaw ay wagas na tinubos; huwag kayong magpapaalipin sa mga tao.

[^23]: You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of people.

Mga kapatid, ang bawat isa ay dapat manatili sa Diyos sa sitwasyon kung saan tinawag siya ng Diyos.

[^24]: Brothers and sisters, each person is to remain with God in the situation in which he was called.

ABOUT THE UNMARRIED AND WIDOWS

[^25]: Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I do give an opinion as one who by the Lord’s mercy is faithful.

[^26]: Because of the present distress, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is.

[^27]: Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.

[^28]: However, if you do get married, you have not sinned, and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But such people will have trouble in this life, and I am trying to spare you.

[^29]: This is what I mean, brothers and sisters: The time is limited, so from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none,

[^30]: those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they didn’t own anything,

[^31]: and those who use the world as though they did not make full use of it. For this world in its current form is passing away.

[^32]: I want you to be without concerns. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord ​— ​how he may please the Lord.

[^33]: But the married man is concerned about the things of the world ​— ​how he may please his wife ​—

[^34]: and his interests are divided. The unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But the married woman is concerned about the things of the world ​— ​how she may please her husband.

[^35]: I am saying this for your own benefit, not to put a restraint on you, but to promote what is proper and so that you may be devoted to the Lord without distraction.

[^36]: If any man thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, if she is getting beyond the usual age for marriage, and he feels he should marry ​— ​he can do what he wants. He is not sinning; they can get married.

[^37]: But he who stands firm in his heart (who is under no compulsion, but has control over his own will ) and has decided in his heart to keep her as his fiancée, will do well.

[^38]: So, then, he who marries his fiancée does well, but he who does not marry will do better.

[^39]: A wife is bound as long as her husband is living. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to anyone she wants ​— ​only in the Lord.

[^40]: But she is happier if she remains as she is, in my opinion. And I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
